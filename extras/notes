0 has undefined usage with string
0 is cancelled out if - is present
if l is present automatically become l

Modifiers:
- if star but no modifier, nothing happens
- # only relevent for Xx and oO (hexadecimal and octal)
- 0 gives 0 padding, but if there is a minus it is overwritten,
- + sign doesn-t work with u
- location of star doesn't matter
- 0 and + work together
- - overrides 0 and ' '
- '0' ovverrides ' '
- + ovverrides ' '
- * on it's own default behaviour is to add spaces at front
- ' ' always puts a space at front, no matter number

Ascendency summary:

1. '-' > '0' > ' '
2. '+' works in all cases, and acts like ' ' if no other modifiers used.
3. if no flags and only star, works ike ' '


pseudocode

if 0, call 0 function, if ' ', call ' ' function,
put_nbr
if '-', call minus function
